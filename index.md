# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, Part 1
  
A major reason as to why Lab 1 part 1 is one of my favorite labs has to be because this was our first step into coding. I really enjoyed this lab because we learned about how to code using C++, and the different styles C++ had to offer. Not only this, but we learned how to use the git commands which stuck with us all semester!

* Lab 4, Part 2
  
I also really enjoyed lab 4 part 2 and thatâ€™s because we had to create a number guessing game which was really awesome in my opinion. It required us to really think about how to code certain functions and it felt almost like a puzzle!  Overall, I feel like this project is the one that really got me into coding most definitely!

* Lab 9, Part 1
  
This lab was definitely a struggle at first but in the end felt very accomplishing after completing it. We were able to calculate the averages using the loops we learned about and it was very interesting! Although it was a rough patch it definitely helped me push through the rest of my projects and develop a larger skill set in programming.
